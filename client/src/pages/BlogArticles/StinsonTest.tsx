                An 800-Pound Masterpiece: The Stinson "S-Base" Walnut Table

                  Designed and built entirely in-house by Texas Urban Sawmill, the Stinson Gallery walnut dining table is a truly one-of-a-kind creation. From the custom-fabricated steel base to the 3-inch-thick solid walnut slab top, no other table like it exists anywhere in the world.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The full process—from design through fabrication and finishing—spanned more than six months, a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship behind the piece. Work of this caliber cannot be rushed, and the patience of our clients was a key factor in achieving its elegance and rare beauty.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The steel base, designed in collaboration with our clients and handbuilt by Devin Ginther, highlights his expertise as a metal fabricator and design engineer. With over 30 years of MIG and TIG welding experience—honed originally on custom Jeeps and hot rods—Devin applied his skills to create a refined architectural form.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The tabletop was crafted from a single old-growth black walnut tree over 70 inches in diameter—the largest live-edge slab ever used by Texas Urban Sawmill. Jesse Mahoney oversaw the selection, design, and finishing, highlighting the subtle beauty of the wood's natural wane and eye-opening character. Walnut trees of this size are exceptionally rare, especially in Texas, and this remarkable slab was sourced from Oregon.

                  The base design was inspired by our client's last name, making it truly personal. Fabricated entirely in-house, from bending the steel to precise TIG and MIG welding, the base took about three months to complete. Its 13 steel components are seamlessly integrated into a striking sculpture.

                  The lead designers at Texas Urban Sawmill set out to create a base that was truly one-of-a-kind, unlike anything else in the world. They combined the modern aesthetic of a handcrafted steel structure with the warmth of a solid 3-inch walnut slab, shaped with custom tooling to achieve a distinctive and elegant edge profile.

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#3d3d3d]">
                  The base is a work of art in its own right—a handcrafted sculpture that showcases the meticulous attention to detail and exceptional craftsmanship of Texas Urban Sawmill. Its beauty stands alone, commanding admiration from every angle. The base alone weighs over 500 lbs, and combined with the solid 3-inch walnut top, the finished table tips the scales at approximately 800 lbs!

                    Given the high cost of bronze electro-plating, our clients chose a custom-painted base, perfectly color-matched to the fixtures in their new home. The base was professionally finished by a custom hot-rod paint shop, providing a superior, durable alternative to industrial powder coating. This is an epoxy base coat after the initial "body" work was complete.
