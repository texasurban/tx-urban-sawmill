                At Texas Urban Sawmill, we believe that sustainable business practices and community engagement go hand in hand. Through our commitment to rescuing urban trees, supporting local education, and partnering with organizations that share our values, we're creating positive change that extends far beyond our sawmill.

                  Education is at the heart of our community impact. We partner with schools, universities, and professional organizations to share knowledge about sustainable forestry, urban wood utilization, and the importance of environmental stewardship. Through workshops, speaking engagements, and mentorship programs, we're helping the next generation understand that rescued wood isn't waste—it's an opportunity.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#3d3d3d] mb-6">
                  Our involvement with Texas A&M Forest Service Leadership Institute, the International Society of Arborists, and the Urban Wood Network reflects our commitment to advancing industry standards and sharing best practices that benefit the entire forestry and construction communities.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#3d3d3d]">
                  By investing in education and professional development, we're helping to create a future where sustainable urban wood utilization becomes the standard practice, not the exception.

              </h2>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#3d3d3d] mb-6">
                As a Texas Benefit Company, we're committed to using our success to support causes that align with our values. We make significant charitable contributions to organizations focused on environmental conservation, urban forestry, and community development. Our largest single donation to the TAMFS TreeCovery Fund demonstrates our commitment to reforestation and forest health across Texas.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#3d3d3d] mb-6">
                These contributions aren't just financial—they represent our belief that businesses have a responsibility to strengthen the communities they serve. Every tree we rescue, every piece of wood we transform, and every product we create contributes to a legacy of environmental stewardship and community prosperity.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#3d3d3d]">
                We're proud to support organizations like Austin Habitat for Humanity, Texas Parks & Wildlife, and local conservation initiatives that are working to protect and restore our natural heritage.

                </h2>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#3d3d3d] mb-6">
                  Our community impact work has been recognized through numerous awards and accolades. The Texas Parks & Wildlife Texas Trailblazer Award, USDA Forest Service Wood Innovations Grants, and recognition from the Urban Wood Network reflect our dedication to sustainable practices and community leadership.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#3d3d3d] mb-6">
                  These recognitions inspire us to continue pushing boundaries and setting new standards for what's possible when business success aligns with environmental responsibility and community benefit.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#3d3d3d]">
                  But the greatest recognition comes from the communities we serve—from the families living in homes built with our sustainable materials, from students learning about forestry and environmental stewardship, and from the trees we've rescued that continue to provide value for generations to come.
