                  A 300-Year-Old Walnut Slab from Oregon
                </h2>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#3d3d3d] mb-8">
                  It all began with a massive old-growth black walnut slab from Oregon. Harvested from a 300-year-old tree over 70 inches in diameter, this 3-inch-thick slab was carefully kiln-dried to preserve its character and stability. The tabletop was crafted from this single old-growth black walnut tree—the largest live-edge slab ever used by Texas Urban Sawmill. Walnut trees of this size are exceptionally rare, especially in Texas, making this remarkable slab a true treasure.

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#3d3d3d] mb-8">
                  Jesse Mahoney oversaw the selection, design, and finishing, highlighting the subtle beauty of the wood's natural wane and eye-opening character. Extra care and attention went into the final finish of the walnut. Jesse worked to maximize the rich color tones while highlighting the dramatic figure and unique character of this rare grain.

                The Sculptural Steel Base: A Work of Art
              </h2>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#3d3d3d] mb-8">
                The steel base, designed in collaboration with the Stinson family and handbuilt by Devin Ginther, highlights his expertise as a metal fabricator and design engineer. With over 30 years of MIG and TIG welding experience—honed originally on custom Jeeps and hot rods—Devin applied his skills to create a refined architectural form inspired by the client's last name, making it truly personal.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#3d3d3d] mb-8">
                Fabricated entirely in-house, from bending the steel to precise TIG and MIG welding, the base took about three months to complete. Its 13 steel components are seamlessly integrated into a striking sculpture. The lead designers at Texas Urban Sawmill set out to create a base that was truly one-of-a-kind, unlike anything else in the world. They combined the modern aesthetic of a handcrafted steel structure with the warmth of a solid 3-inch walnut slab, shaped with custom tooling to achieve a distinctive and elegant edge profile.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#3d3d3d] mb-8">
                The base is a work of art in its own right—a handcrafted sculpture that showcases the meticulous attention to detail and exceptional craftsmanship of Texas Urban Sawmill. Its beauty stands alone, commanding admiration from every angle. The base alone weighs over 500 lbs, and combined with the solid 3-inch walnut top, the finished table tips the scales at approximately 800 lbs!

                </h2>

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#3d3d3d] mb-8">
                  Given the high cost of bronze electro-plating, the Stinson family chose a custom-painted base, perfectly color-matched to the fixtures in their new home. The base was professionally finished by a custom hot-rod paint shop, providing a superior, durable alternative to industrial powder coating. The base was primed with a 2-part epoxy, received 2 color-matched coats, and a final satin-matte clear coat for a refined, lasting finish.

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#3d3d3d] mb-8">
                  Behold the breathtaking fiddleback figuring that flows across the entire surface of this walnut slab. Coveted for its rare, shimmering chatoyance, fiddleback embodies luxury and precision, revered in the gunstock industry and beyond for its unparalleled beauty. You can also see the precision recess for the base top mount, which sits flush with the underside of the tabletop, showcasing the meticulous engineering that went into every aspect of this piece.

                Installing this dining table in the newly constructed home took nearly three hours of careful, precise work.
