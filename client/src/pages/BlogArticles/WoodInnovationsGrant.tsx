                  Texas is the second most disaster-prone state in the U.S. after California, according to FEMA disaster declarations. Rapid population growth, unsustainable forest management, and expansion into the wildland-urban interface (WUI) have increased wildfire risk across Central Texas, making it one of the state's most vulnerable regions. Ashe juniper, commonly known as mountain cedar, is a major source of combustible fuel in these woodlands. Traditionally, this material is chipped or burned after removal, a practice that fails to preserve long-term carbon sequestration.

                <p>
                  Texas Urban Sawmill is investigating a novel economic approach that not only utilizes excess wood material for economic gain but also reduces the threat of wildfires. This innovative model generates revenue that can be used to fund replanting and expand the tree canopy. The material rescued from these project sites will be milled and then offered as retail lumber at the <a href="https://austinhabitat.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#1a4d2e] font-semibold hover:underline">Austin Habitat ReStores</a>. 100% of profits will directly support the <a href="https://austinhabitat.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#1a4d2e] font-semibold hover:underline">Austin Habitat for Humanity (HFH)</a> for affordable housing projects and the <a href="https://tfsweb.tamu.edu/trees/tree-care/trees-and-natural-disasters/treecovery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#1a4d2e] font-semibold hover:underline">Texas A&M Forest Service (TAMFS)</a> for tree canopy expansion.
