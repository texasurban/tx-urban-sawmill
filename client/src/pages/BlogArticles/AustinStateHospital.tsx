                The Austin State Hospital project represents one of the largest tree re-use initiatives in the State of Texas. Involving over 60 old growth trees from the historically registered grounds, this groundbreaking project demonstrates how adaptive tree re-use can transform construction waste into meaningful, sustainable design elements.

                Texas Urban Sawmill transported over 200 logs from the construction site over a period of 3 months during the initial project phases. This comprehensive effort showcases our commitment to sustainability, community stewardship, and the creative reuse of materials that might otherwise end up in landfills.

                The interior design elements of the project focused on the unique qualities and beauty of the State Tree of Texas. The Texas Urban Sawmill additionally repurposed a variety of additional species such as sycamore and live oaks, which we sold back into the community as kiln-dried lumber or heirloom furniture pieces.

                These historical trees, which had stood on the hospital grounds for generations, now serve as lasting reminders of stewardship and sustainability. Their transformation into functional architectural elements demonstrates how heritage materials can be honored while meeting modern construction standards.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#3d3d3d] mb-6">
                With over half a dozen natural hardwood nursing care stations, the hospital provides much-needed warmth to an otherwise clinical environment. Incorporating natural wood into interior spaces does more than enhance aesthetics—it supports mental well-being.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#3d3d3d] mb-6">
                Research shows that wood surfaces can lower cortisol levels, helping reduce stress in a way that mirrors the calming effects of nature. Its warm tones and organic textures create a soothing atmosphere that boosts mood and emotional comfort.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#3d3d3d] mb-8">
                Additionally, wood's biophilic qualities have been linked to improved focus, creativity, and cognitive performance, making it a smart choice for healthcare facilities, schools, and workspaces alike.
